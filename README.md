# Project Template: Advanced Portfolio Intelligence Through Semantic Analysis at Low Risk Capital Management
# Background Scenario
A Data Scientist at Low Risk Capital Management (LRCM), a quantitative hedge fund managing $15 billion in assets. The fund's founder and CIO has identified a critical limitation in the firm's investment strategy. The traditional sector classifications (GICS, BICS) are increasingly outdated for capturing the nuances of modern technology companies.

# The challenge: 
"A company like Microsoft is classified as 'Software & Services,' but that tells us nothing about their quantum computing research, AI infrastructure, or nuclear power investments for data centers. Tesla is 'Consumer Discretionary,' yet they're developing humanoid robots and autonomous AI. We're missing massive investment opportunities because we're using 20th-century classifications for 21st-century companies."

# Your mission: 
Build an advanced company intelligence system using Wikipedia data and embedding models to:

- Identify companies involved in emerging technologies regardless of official sector classification
- Create semantic search capabilities for finding investment opportunities in specific themes
- Reclassify companies based on their actual business activities rather than legacy sectors
- Generate actionable investment ideas for LRCM's thematic portfolios

# The Business Problem
Your system will be used to identify companies for LRCM's Expanded Thematic Mandates:

- AI Infrastructure, Chips, Generative AI Platforms & Enterprise Software
- Cloud Computing, Data Centers, Hyperscalers & Network Infrastructure
- Nuclear, Renewable Energy, Grid Storage & Power for Digital Infrastructure
- Cryptocurrency, Digital Assets, Mining & Blockchain Infrastructure
- Quantum Computing, Next-Gen Computing & Advanced Semiconductors
- Robotics, Automation, Autonomous Vehicles & Industrial AI Systems
- AI-Powered Cybersecurity & Network Security Platforms
- Digital Finance, Payments, Neobanks & Fintech Infrastructure
- Metaverse, AR/VR, Gaming & Digital Reality Platforms
- Gene Editing, Synthetic Biology, AI Drug Discovery & Digital Health

# Current challenges:

- Bloomberg's sector data misses cross-industry innovation
- Emerging technologies span multiple traditional sectors
- No systematic way to identify "AI makers" vs "AI users."
- Missing investment opportunities in companies pivoting to new technologies
